/**
 * The level-3 witness, checked where it can be checked cheaply.

 * The half that matters most is not here: it is that removing
 * `provides(scrollPort.block)` from `shell.main` makes `npx tsc -p
 * apps/demo/tsconfig.app.json` fail, before the app ever starts. That was run,
 * and the message it produced is quoted below so a reader can judge it without
 * reproducing the failure.
