/**
 * The case that motivated the whole thing.
 *
 * A back-to-top button is `position: sticky` and reads its scroll state through
 * a container query. Both need something it cannot provide itself: a scroll
 * port on the block axis, and an element declaring `container-type:
 * scroll-state`. The scroll port owns the latter because it is the element
 * whose scrollability the button needs to observe.
 *
 * `requires(...)` is attached to the class that depends on it, not to the sheet:
 * the error then names a rule rather than a file.
